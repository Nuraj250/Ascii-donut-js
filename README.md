# 🍩 ASCII Donut (JavaScript Version)

A rotating 3D ASCII donut rendered inside your browser using pure JavaScript and HTML.  
This project is inspired by the legendary [donut.c](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html) written in C!

## 🚀 Live Demo

Coming soon... (or you can open the `donut.html` file locally in your browser!)

## 📜 How It Works

- Math magic (sine, cosine, rotation matrices).
- Simple terminal-style ASCII rendering using `<pre>` and `textContent`.
- Frame-by-frame animation using `setInterval`.

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ascii-donut-js.git
   ```
